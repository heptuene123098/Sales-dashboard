        <li><h3>Yearly Sales Trend</h3></li>
        <p>A look at the yearly sales trend over three years shows significant variation:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>2004:</strong> $4.72m - Significant increase, indicating growth.</li>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The analysis indicates a highly volatile
    sales environment, with a significant variation monthly and quarterly.
    Classic cars are their most valuable and sought-after product line, 
    while trains sell poorly. Yearly data suggests 
    that while there was strong growth from 2003 to 2004, 
    the first half of 2005 saw a substantial downturn, 
    highlighting areas for potential investigation and 
    strategic adjustment.</p>
